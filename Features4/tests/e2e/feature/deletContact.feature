Feature:
    As user
    I want to delete added Contact
    So that I can remove the unwanted contact from my contact list.


Background:
#  Assuming that the follwing user has been registerd
    Given the user has logged in with valid email address "deekshyap@gmail.com" and valid password "123456"
    And the user has been navigated to the home page

        Given the following contacts have been created
            | name | email         | phone      | contact type|

        When the user deletes a contact with email "xyz@gmail.com"  
        Then the contact with email "xyz@gmail.com" should be removed from contact list
        But  the contact with email "abc@gmail.com" should appear in the contact list.
