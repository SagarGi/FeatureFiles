    So that contact will be removed from contact list

    Background:

        When User deletes a contact with email "<email>"
        Then that contact with email "<emai>" should be removed from contact list 
        Examples:
            |name|email        |phone     |contact-type|
            |xyz |xyz@gmail.com|9876543210|personal    |
